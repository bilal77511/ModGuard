## Usage

### Running the Application

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the Django development server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

The development server will start running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

### Accessing Endpoints

Once the server is running, you can access the following endpoints:

- Single message: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/your_app/single_message/`
- Message list: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/your_app/message_list/`

## Customization

### Editing Functions

To edit the functions and customize the behavior of the application:

1. Navigate to the appropriate views file (`views.py`) in your Django app.
2. Open the file in a text editor.
3. Locate the functions you want to edit (e.g., `single_message`, `message_list`).
4. Modify the function logic according to your requirements.
5. Save the file.

After editing the functions, make sure to restart the Django development server for the changes to take effect.
